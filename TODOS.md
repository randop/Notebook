That is a message from the "Decoder Doctor' that is displayed as a notification bar if there is no suitable codec found to play the media file.

    decoder.noCodecs.message = To play video, you may need to install Microsoft‚Äôs Media Feature Pack. 

Does the Web Console (or Browser Console) show more detail about what codec is missing?

I see see this pref present on the about:config page to switch verbose mode on/off.

    media.decoder-doctor.verbose 

The messages that are allows are specified via this pref:

    media.decoder-doctor.notifications-allowed 

I think that you can set this pref to an empty value (right-click and clear the current String value) to suppress the notifications.

You can open the about:config page via the location/address bar. You can accept the warning and click "I accept the risk!" to continue.
