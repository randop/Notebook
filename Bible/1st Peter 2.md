### Verses: 1,2,3,4,5
> WHEREFORE laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,

> As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:

> If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.

> To whom coming, as unto a lving stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,

> Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.
