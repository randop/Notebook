### Verses: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7
> AND he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.

> In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded here fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.

> And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:

> And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads.

> And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.

> And he said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done.

> Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book.
