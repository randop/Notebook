1:12
And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,
    Reuben 
        was the eldest son of Jacob and Leah
        Tribe of Reuben symbol is mandrake (fertility flower)       
        Genesis 49:3-4
            Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:
            Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.

    Gad
        was the seventh son of Jacob with Zilpah, the handmaind servant of Leah
        Genesis 49:19
            Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.


At the end of Israel’s 40-year wilderness wandering, as the people prepared to enter the Promised Land, Gad’s tribe asked to settle east of the Jordan River along with Reuben and the half-tribe of Manasseh. These tribes owned a substantial amount of livestock, and the territory east of the Jordan was desirable for raising herds. Dwelling in a bordering position east of the Jordan, it was particularly important for Gad to fulfill Jacob’s prophecy and be brave and strong. Otherwise, Israel would be vulnerable to sudden enemy attacks. [2]
