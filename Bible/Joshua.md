1:12
And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,
    Reuben 
        was the eldest son of Jacob and Leah
        Tribe of Reuben symbol is mandrake (fertility flower)       
        Genesis 49:3-4
            Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:
            Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.
