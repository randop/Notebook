### Verses: 20,21,22,23,24,25
> But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,

> Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.

> And of some have compassion, making a difference:

> And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.

> Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless, before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,

> To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.
