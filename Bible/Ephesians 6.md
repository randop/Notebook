### Verses: 10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24

> Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.

> Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.

> For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.

> Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.

> Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;

> And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;

> Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.

> And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:

> Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;

> And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,

> For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.

> But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:

> Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.

> Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

> Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen
