### Chapter: 4
#### Verses: 8,9,10
> For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.

> This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.

> For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.
